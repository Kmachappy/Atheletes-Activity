# Goal and what this tries to achieve
- Athelets today do not have a centralized site to view their Atheletic activities from runs, cycling and swimming. Today Atheletes depend on their phone to view their activities, that are tracked by a plethora of activity tracking apps such as Strava, Nike - Run Club, Asics - RunKeeper, UnderArmor - Map my Run, AllTrails, ect. 

- The goal of this page is to be able to pull all data from all apps and display all Activity information in one centralized page

- In progress: users will be able to login and authorize strava to allow me to use and propagated their own use data

- users will be able to see past activities with map data

- user will be able to see their average data points and highest data point
    - avg hr, avg pace, avg run, best miles, longest milage, 

-	Atheletes need an easy to access website to view their atheletic activities across different plateforms and their visualization.
